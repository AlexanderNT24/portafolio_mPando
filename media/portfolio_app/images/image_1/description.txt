The french colonial cinema has influenced the Moroccan
Director Mohamed Osfour (1927-2005) whose movies
featured moroccan actors playing westernized characters
such as Tarzan, Robin Hood or Othello. The characters
were in some way quickly accepted as mirrors of
migratory progress in the collective imagination of the
bidonvilles. I am using the character Tarzan as my alter
ego to explore Paris cinematographically. Tarzan will be
intervening with the different ideas of the exotic in
the Parisian architecture and public space. The scenes
are inspired by comic book versions of Tarzan from
different times and countries.
