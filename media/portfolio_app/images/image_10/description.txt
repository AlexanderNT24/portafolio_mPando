                        Historically, the boat exemplifies the adventure of
                        discovery of the unknown and lost paradise. Nowadays
                        citizens from those places that have been discovered,
                        travel by boats in the hope for freedom in
                        countries of the “discoverers”. As a temporary Dutch
                        citizen I developed a collaboration project with
                        immigrants living in The Netherlands. From the shore of
                        the Dutch sea, as a metaphor of the discoverer’s journey
                        and the journey of those who were discovered, the
                        immigrants performed a walk in a shape of a boat through
                        the city of Amsterdam and back to the sea. The narrow
                        streets and main squares of Amsterdam represent the
                        historical stage of past and present.
