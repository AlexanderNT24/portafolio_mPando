                        In 2008 I made the video-performance called "8 Hours
                        work" during a one-month residency in an abandoned
                        apartment block (Plattenbau) in Hoyerswerda (East
                        Germany), a former stronghold of the coal mining
                        industry. As a manifestation of solidarity and
                        remembrance, I performa labors day by holding a
                        carnation flower (Rote Nelke) for a period of eight
                        hours.
                      

                        Since the outbreak of Covid-19, those ordinary jobs are
                        more recognized fortheir huge impact on society.
                        Former regular jobs are considered honorable, the
                        workers heroes and “system relevance” goes fromordinary
                        to extraordinary
