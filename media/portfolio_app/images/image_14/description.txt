In Lima-Peru there are more than twenty cinemas from the 50’s and 60’s. But during the 80’s VHS and multi cinemas got introduced, and the economic order collapsed. Now those spaces are empty, destroyed and start disappearing.This film is a short animation as a visual memory of twelve unique facades of old cinemas showing their particular arquitecture. The facades are made with cinema charcoal used as a recycled material. Cinema charcoal was used to produce the 35mm projector light during the 50’s and 60’s.
