The Cockroach and the Beetle are insects that have very symbolic meaning in the world as small creatures of fantasy and imagination. The cockroach is an insect that survived the Jurassic era and is resistant to nuclear radiation exposure. The beetle is another insect that has fascinated the Egyptians because it is related to the idea of transformation and rebirth. Either insect could be the protagonist in the imaginative book The Metamorphosis of Franz Kafka. I have created this story as a result of my desire to be honest and to change my behavior towards other people. For this reason, I posed as political figure that makes promises, and has to fulfill his words. The symbolic transformation of the Bug Man (cockroach and Beetle) who is displace from the city (cockroach) to the country side (beetle) can be seen as a process of survival and rebirth.
