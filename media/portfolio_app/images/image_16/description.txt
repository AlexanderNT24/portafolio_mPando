                        The nostalgia of traveling to the city by the majority
                        of provincial people is reflected in the music of
                        Lorenzo Palacios Quispe, known as Chacalon. The singer
                        became an idol, because the people identified with his
                        songs; his lyrics became part of the collective memory
                        in the suburb’s life of Lima. During my research of this
                        personage I found a very peculiar comic strip of the
                        pharaoh Lorenzo Palacios Quispe. The comic strip shows
                        amusing and very simple drawings of his life as a
                        popular icon. In “The king of the Mountains” I
                        transferred the comic strip into an animated film. I
                        began to draw each fragment of the comic strip with a
                        knife and felt pens on 35 mm film. The film is inserted
                        in an Old Russian handle projector accompanied with
                        songs of Chacalon.
