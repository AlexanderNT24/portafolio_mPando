                        "Pirañitas" and "Gallinazos" share the same urban space
                        in the centre of Lima. "Pirañitas" is a nickname for
                        young gangs of teenagers that live on the city streets.
                        Normally those teenagers hang around in groups of 10 or
                        15 individuals for the purpose of mugging people. The
                        "Gallinazos" are birds that fly above the roofs of old
                        colonial houses. In the Rimac river, "Pirañitas" and
                        "Gallinazos"; are living together between abandoned
                        trashy places, both groups spend their days planning and
                        looking for victims to assault. In this project I
                        address the "Pirañitas" as "Gallinazos".
