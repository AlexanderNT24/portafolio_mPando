                        In reference to the aesthetics of Jean Rouch’s and Ben
                        Russells films, ‘Dracula Reloaded’ is an ethnographic
                        and hallucinatory cinema. The project combines two
                        Latin-American music and dance styles that have close
                        historical colonial contexts. The carnival music from
                        Cajamarca has Spanish influences and the community of
                        Saamakas are descendants of African slaves living with
                        their ancestral traditions in the former Dutch colony
                        Suriname.In the video Dracula walks into a
                        Saamakan village, and the dancers and singers are
                        starting to play carnival music from Cajamarca . Dracula
                        sings a song. Gradually the music changes, mixing the
                        villagers drums with the carnival. The sound grows
                        stronger and wilder, creating a new music rhythm.
