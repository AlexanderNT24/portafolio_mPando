 A louse is a sacred insect. Lots of small papers with the image of louses are symbolically jumping in a glass box divided in three levels: the alive, the dead and beyond other world levels. I materialize symbolically the creation of the world from the perspective view of the first pre-Spanish cultures in Peru.
