‘Projection’ for Sigmund Freud is a mechanism of defense in which a person rejects his or her own unacceptable attributes by ascribing them to objects or persons outside world, something that brings ‘mental relief’. After visiting several historical museums in Berlin.  I was trigger by the shadows behind the sculptures that are by coincident projected on walls and floors of those institutions. This type of illumination creates a completely different aura compared to the archeological sites where those sculptures had been originally found. I started to take photos of those shadows and at a later stage transferred those abstract shadows into silhouettes of cardboard. The short film shows my walks from one museum in Berlin to another: carrying, mixing and exchanging silhouettes of different gods made with cardboard. With the joint of silhouettes of cardboard-gods I made 'Transformer'. A travel machine through different histories and ages.
