Back To The Temple Of The Sun is a travelogue set in the desserts, mountains and jungle of Peru. We are embarking on a cinematographic journey with the comic book hero Tintin. As always, Tintin is accompanied by his loyal friend Snowy. This time he is not a white terrier but a hairless Peruvian dog characterized as a portable pharmacy in the shape of a wooden trolley and a hot water bottle. Our Peruvian Tintin is also not a blonde, confident and young, daring detective but an anti-hero. A lone, naïve but sympathetic traveller, wandering through stunning landscapes, on a quest to discover his own contemporary Peru. He transforms the European view and the gathered local facts into new interpretations of old mystical tales. We see him carrying illuminating ice back to the glacier and he changes into a leopard in the jungle. Original footage from the animation film Tintin et le Temple du Soleil made by Belair Studios in 1969 is interwoven with images from the real Peru.
