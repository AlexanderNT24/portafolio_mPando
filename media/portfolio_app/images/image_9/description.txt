                        “Panoramas” (2011) In the same way that I had previously
                        drawn and scratched on pitch-black strips of film
                        now I draw landscapes of the Amazon rain forest on the
                        black surfaces of leftover oil inside the buckets.
                        Looking at the drawings, one inevitably first thinks of
                        traditional techniques but my method of drawing is
                        simple, just wiping away and drawing in the black oil.
                        Using a small, round hole in a washtub, I offer to the
                        viewer a panoramic, almost filmic vision of the
                        landscape, magically transformed them into a looking
                        box, a magic lantern. test
